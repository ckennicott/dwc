  <h2>Supplies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 <a href="http://amzn.to/2k81M4Z">plastic cup</a> for each player</li>
    <li>1 beer for each player</li>
    <li>Long, sturdy table</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How To Play</h2>
  <p>Start by dividing players into two equal teams. Each player stands shoulder to shoulder, next to their teammates, along the long side, of the table. Next each player fills their cup with beer (players should agree how full to fill the cups before starting).</p>
  <p>To start the game someone yells “GO!” </p>
  <p>After hearing “GO” the first player on each team chugs their beer and sets it down on the edge of the table. Half of the bottom of the cup should be hanging over the edge of the table. Once setting their cup down, the player attempts to flip the cup and land it upside down on the table. If the player is successful the next player on their team can start chugging and attempt to flip their cup. </p>
  <p>The first team to chug all of their beer and flip their cups upside down wins.</p>
