          <h3>Chuck's House rules</h3>
          <p>These rules originated from house parties at Western Oregon University. Credit goes to Jeff McClay for compiling the list of rules.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Cup Formation - Start with 10 cups in a pyramid formation, next is 6 in the pyramid, then 3, I-formation at 2, last cup is centered. Shooting team must call for the re-formation of the cups when it is their turn to shoot. If one player shoots before reformation is called for they must wait till it is their next turn to get it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Turns - Each player on a team gets a chance/has to shoot, they cannot forfeit their shot to their teammate. If all players on the team make a shot that team gets the balls back and shoot again. If the shooting players make the same cup they get balls back and the other team must drink one extra cup (total of 3); the shooting team may request that the first made ball be pulled out of the cup before the next shot.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bounce - If a player on the shooting team bounces the ball on the table and it lands in the other teams cups, the defending team must drink 2 cups.
            </li>
            <li>
              Defense - The ball cannot be touched while it is in the air. Once the ball hits any surface (table or cups) the ball is fair game (this includes if the shooting player tries to bounce the ball into the cup) and can be blocked. The defending team has the ability to “pick” the ball out of the cup if it is spinning with their fingers but the ball/fingers cannot touch the liquid in the cup; if anything is wet the shot counts as a made cup.
            </li>
            <li>
              Money Shot - If a shooting player makes their shot into the drink cup (any cup the opposing team is drinking out of) of the opposing team the game is over, no matter how many cups are still on the table!
            </li>
            <li>
              End Game - Once the final cup is made by a team the game is over. However, the “losing” team has the chance to make a rebuttal shot, they have one shot to make a cup, if it is made the game keeps going if they miss it is over. If all teammates make the last cup on the shooting team there is no chance for a rebuttal shot.
